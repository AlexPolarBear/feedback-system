Bioinformatics Algorithms
The course will cover the algorithmic foundations of bioinformatics, ranging from generic
algorithmic techniques to specific algorithms used in various areas of computational biology. In
particular, topics include string algorithms used in the analysis of biological sequences;
combinatorial algorithms for gene finding and motif discovery; graph algorithms used in genome
assembly and comparative genomics; clustering algorithms for the gene expression analysis and
reconstruction of evolutionary trees. Theoretical background will be complemented with solving
practical problems (coding challenges). This course will be given in a flipped classroom format.
All text and video materials will be available online and should be studied beforehand. The class
time will be dedicated to resolving learning breakdowns, answering curiosity questions and
discussions. All course materials are in English
