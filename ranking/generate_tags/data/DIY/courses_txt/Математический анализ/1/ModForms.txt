Introduction to Modular Forms
D. V. Adler
DESCRIPTION: This course is an introduction to the theory of modular
forms. A modular form is a function on the complex upper half plane that
satisfies holomorphy conditions and certain transformation condition with
respect to the action of the modular group SL2(Z) or one of its subgroups
(so called congruence subgroups). Modular forms are useful in various areas
of mathematics from number theory to mathematical physics. On the other
hand, the theory of modular forms combines some methods from different
branches like complex analysis, topology, differential geometry, and number
theory. In our course we will make the first steps in studying this beautiful
theory.
This course is designed for 2-4 year bachelor and graduate students.
